Vagrant-Metasploit
==================
Vagrant Box that will deploy Ubuntu 14.04 Server with bleeding edge Nmap, Veil-Evasion and the Metasploit Framework all from latest sources. What could be better? The whole build takes few minutes so go grab coffee after this thing starts.


Don't want to use Vagrant? Thats cool, run this shell script on any fresh Ubuntu box and you're ready to rock. 

for the particularly brave 
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maus-/vagrant-metasploit/master/scripts/buildmsf.sh | sh
```
